# jagsNEC

'jagsNEC' is an R package to fit concentration(dose) - response curves to toxicity data, and derive No-Effect-Concentration (NEC), No-Significant-Effect-Concentration (NSEC), and Effect-Concentration (of specified percentage 'x', ECx) thresholds from non-linear models fitted using Bayesian MCMC fitting methods via the R2jags package and jags.

# Background

Bayesian model fitting can be difficult to automate across a broad range of usage cases, particularly with respect to specifying valid initial values and appropriately vague priors. This is one reason the use of Bayesian statistics for NEC estimation is not currently widely adopted across the broader ecotoxicological community, who rarely have access to specialist statistical expertise. The jagsNEC package attempts to provide an accessible interface to the R2jags package specifically for fitting NEC models, with a range of models specified based on the known distribution of the "concentration" or "dose" variable (the predictor, x) as well as the "response" (y) variable. The model formula, including priors and the required init function required to call a jags model are automatically generated based on information contained in the supplied data. While the distribution of the x and y variables can be specified directly, jagsNEC will automatically 'guess' the correct distribution to use, based on the characteristics of the provided data. See ?write.jags.NECmod for the currently available x and y data types.

This project started with an implementation of the NEC model based on that described in [@Fox2010]. That package has been further generalised to allow a large range of response variables to be modelled using the appropriate statistical distribution, and the current implementation supports gaussian, poisson, binomial, gamma, negbin and beta response data. We have further added a range of alternative NEC model types, as well as a range of typically used concentration-response models (such as 4-parameter logistic and weibull models) that have no NEC 'step' function but simply model response as a smooth function of concentration. 

Models can be fit directly using fit.jagsNEC, or alternatively using the function fit.jagsMANEC it is possible to fit a specific set or all of the available models. The fit.jagsMANEC function returns a model weighted estimate of predicted posterior values, based on DIC model weights. It is also possible to obtain all individual model fits from the fitted jagsMANECfit model object if required. 

An additional endpoint has also been derived using Bayesian posterior predicted values to estimate the "No-Statistical-Effect-Concentration" as the concentration at which predicted values for each MCMC chain fall below a lower percentile bound (defined as sig.val) of the control (assumed to be the lowest treatment (x.var) concentration in the data. NSEC estimates are currently used to approximate NEC for models without a specific NEC step parameter (in jagsNEC these have the prefix ECx in their model name).


Important information on the current package is contained in the jagsNEC helpfile (see ?jagsNEC).

This package is currently under development. We are keen on any feedback regarding usage, and especially bug reporting that includes an easy self contained reproducible example of either unexpected behaviour or example model fits that fail to converge (have poor chain mixing) or yield other errors. Such information will hopefully help us towards building a more robust package. We cannot help troublshoot issues if an easy to run reproducible example is not supplied.
