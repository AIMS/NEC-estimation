# jagsNEC

'jagsNEC' is an R package to fit concentration(dose) - response curves to toxicity data, and derive No-Effect-Concentration (NEC), No-Significant-Effect-Concentration (NSEC), and Effect-Concentration (of specified percentage 'x', ECx) thresholds from non-linear models fitted using Bayesian MCMC fitting methods via the R2jags package and jags.

The package supports a range of response families - currently gaussian, poisson, binomial, gamma, lognormal and beta.
