# jagsNEC

'jagsNEC' is an R package to fit concentration(dose) - response curves to toxicity data, and derive No-Effect-Concentration (NEC), No-Significant-Effect-Concentration (NSEC), and Effect-Concentration (of specified percentage 'x', ECx) thresholds from non-linear models fitted using Bayesian MCMC fitting methods via the R2jags package and jags.

# Background

Bayesian model fitting can be difficult to automate across a broad range of usage cases, particularly with respect to specifying valid initial values and appropriate priors. This is one reason the use of Bayesian statistics for NEC estimation (or even ECx estimmation) is not currently widely adopted across the broader ecotoxicological community, who rarely have access to specialist statistical expertise. The jagsNEC package attempts to provide an accessible interface to the R2jags package specifically for fitting NEC models and other concentration-response models, with a range of models specified based on the known distribution of the "concentration" or "dose" variable (the predictor, x) as well as the "response" (y) variable. The model formula, including priors and the required init function required to call a jags model are automatically generated based on information contained in the supplied data. While the distribution of the x and y variables can be specified directly, jagsNEC will automatically 'guess' the correct distribution to use, based on the characteristics of the provided data.

This project started with an implementation of the NEC model based on that described in [@Fox2010]. The package has been further generalised to allow a large range of response variables to be modelled using the appropriate statistical distribution, and the current implementation supports gaussian, poisson, binomial, gamma, negbin and beta response data. We have since also further added a range of alternative NEC model types, as well as a range of typically used concentration-response models (such as 4-parameter logistic and weibull models) that have no NEC 'step' function but simply model response as a smooth function of concentration. 

Models can be fit directly using fit.jagsNEC, or alternatively using the function fit.jagsMANEC it is possible to fit a specific set or all of the available models. The fit.jagsMANEC function returns a model weighted estimate of predicted posterior values, based on DIC model weights. It is also possible to obtain all individual model fits from the fitted jagsMANECfit model object if required. 

An additional endpoint has also been derived using Bayesian posterior predicted values to estimate the "No-Statistical-Effect-Concentration" as the concentration at which predicted values for each MCMC chain fall below a lower percentile bound (defined as sig.val) of the control, which is assumed to be the lowest treatment (x.var) concentration in the data. NSEC estimates are currently used to approximate NEC for models without a specific NEC step parameter (in jagsNEC these have the prefix ECx in their model name).


Important information on the current package is contained in the jagsNEC and jagsMANEC helpfiles (see ?jagsNEC).

This package is currently under development. We are keen on any feedback regarding usage, and especially bug reporting that includes an easy self contained reproducible example of either unexpected behaviour or example model fits that fail to converge (have poor chain mixing) or yield other errors. Such information will hopefully help us towards building a more robust package. We cannot help troublshoot issues if an easy to run reproducible example is not supplied.

# Examples
## Fitting the NEC3param model using fit.jagsNEC

Here we include some examples showing how to use the package to fit an NEC model to binomial, proportional, count and continuous response (y) data. The examples are those used by Gerard Ricardo at: <https://github.com/gerard-ricardo/NECs/blob/master/NECs>. Here we show how to run the same jags models using the jagsNEC package.

### Binomial data

Where data are a count out of a total (such as the percentage survival of individuals, for example) y is binomial. First we read in the binomial example from pastebin, and then plot the "concentration" or x data, in this case raw.x.


```{r get-binomial-data}
binom.data <- read.table("https://pastebin.com/raw/zfrUha88", header = TRUE, dec = ",")
str(binom.data)
binom.data$raw.x <- as.numeric(as.character(binom.data$raw.x))
range(binom.data$raw.x)
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
hist(binom.data$raw.x)
hist(binom.data$suc / binom.data$tot)
```

In this case for x, lowest concentration is 0.1 and the highest is 400. The data are right skewed and on the continuous scale. This type of distribution for the x data are common for concentration response experiments, where the x "concentration" data are the concentration of contaminants, or dilutions. In general we can model x as gamma. The current default in jagsNEC is to estimate the appropriate distribution for both the *y.type* and *x.type* arguments, but it is possible to supply these arguments directly.

The data are clearly binomial, with the header "suc" - indicating the number of 'successes' in the binomial call, with 'tot' clearly indicating the number of trials.

The main 'working' function in jagsNEC is the function fit.jagsNEC, which calls the other necessary functions and fits the jags model. See ?fit.jagsNEC for more details. We run fit.jagsNEC by supplying *data* - a data.frame containing the data for the model fitting, here, binom.data;  *x.var* - the name of the column in *data* which contains the concentration data or 'x' data to be used in the NEC model fit, and *y.var* - the name of the column in *data* which contains the response or 'y' data to be used in the NEC model fit. In our example here, as this is binomial, we must also supply *trials.var*, which is the name of the column in *data* which contains the number of trials in the binomial call.

fit.jagsNEC sill guess the data types for use, although we could specify *y.type* as "binomial" and *x.type* as "gamma". This example fits without specifying either, but trials.var must be supplied.

```{r fit-binomial-NEC, cache=TRUE}
library(jagsNEC)

set.seed(333)
out <- fit.jagsNEC(
  data = binom.data,
  x.var = "raw.x",
  y.var = "suc",
  trials.var = "tot"
)
```

The function shows the progress of the jags fit and returns the usual jags output (with a few other additions to this list). The function *check.chains* can be used to plot the chains and the chain ACF, so we can assess mixing and looks for other potential issues with the model fit. Initially jagsNEC will attempt to use starting values generated by the init function that we have specified for that type of model fit. It will run a small number of iterations and then test for good mixing. If the model fails to fit or the mixing is not very good (among chain variance is a lot bigger than within chain variance) jagsNEC with try up to *n.tries* more times to fit the data using the generated *init* function to try and obtain a successfuly fitted model with good mixing. If this still fails to yield a successful and/or well mixed model, jagsNEC will try up to *n.tries* more times using the default initial values as generated by R2jags. If no model is successfully fit an error will be returned indicating the model could not be fit succesfully. If a model is fit but still has poor mixing even after *n.tries* attempts, the model with the best mixing will be returned, with a warning to cautiously interpret the results and inspect the chain mixing diagnostic plot. 

```{r check-binomial-NEC}
check.chains(out)
```

In our example, the chains are well mixed and our ACF plot looks good, so we can go ahead and interpret this model.


The function *plot* can be used to plot the fitted model. Alternatively you can make your own plot from the data included in the returned list from the call to fit.jagsNEC. In this example, this could be extracted using *out$pred.vals*

```{r plot-binomial-NEC}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
plot(out)
```

### Beta data

Sometimes the response variable is distributed between *0* and *1* but is not a straight forward binomial. A common example in coral ecology is maximum quantum yield (the proportion of light used for photosynthesis when all reaction centres are open) which is a measure of photosynthetic efficiency calculated from PAM data. Here we have a proportion value that is not based on trials and successes. In this case there are no theoretical 'trials' and the data must be modelled using a beta distribution.

```{r fit-beta-NEC, cache=TRUE}
require(tidyverse)
prop.data <- read.table("https://pastebin.com/raw/123jq46d", header = TRUE, dec = ",") %>%
  mutate(
    raw.x = log(as.numeric(as.character(raw.x)) + 1),
    resp = as.numeric(as.character(resp))
  )
set.seed(333)
out <- fit.jagsNEC(
  data = prop.data,
  x.var = "raw.x",
  y.var = "resp",
  n.tries = 1
)
```

```{r check-beta-NEC}
check.chains(out)
```

```{r plot-beta-NEC}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
plot(out)
```

### Poisson data

Where data are a count (of, for example, individuals or cells) y is poisson. Such data are distributed from *0* to *Inf* and are integers. First we read in the count data example from pastebin, and then plot the "concentration" or x data, Again, this is raw.x, and distributed as in our binomial example above.


```{r get-poisson-data}
count.data <- read.table("https://pastebin.com/raw/ENgNSgf7", header = TRUE, dec = ",")
str(count.data)

count.data$raw.x <- as.numeric(as.character(count.data$raw.x))

range(count.data$raw.x)
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
hist(count.data$raw.x)
hist(count.data$count)
```


First we supply *fit.jagsNEC* with *data* (count.data), and specify *x.var* and *y.var*. As we have concentration data, our *x.type* would be the gamma distribution, and *y.type* is "poisson". The default behaviour to guess the variable types works for this example.



```{r fit-poisson-NEC, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(333)
out <- fit.jagsNEC(
  data = count.data,
  x.var = "raw.x",
  y.var = "count"
)
```



```{r check-poisson-NEC}
check.chains(out)
```

```{r plot-poisson-NEC}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
plot(out)
```

### Measure data

Where data are a measured variable (ie length or size)  y is gamma. Such data are distributed from *0+* to *Inf* and are continuous. First we read in the count data example from pastebin, and then plot the "concentration" or x data, Again, this is raw.x, and distributed as in our binomial example above.

```{r get-measure-data}
measure.data <- read.table("https://pastebin.com/raw/pWeS6x0n", header = TRUE, dec = ",")
measure.data$raw.x <- as.numeric(as.character(measure.data$raw.x))
measure.data$measure <- as.numeric(as.character(measure.data$measure))
```


```{r fit-measure-NEC, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(333)
out <- fit.jagsNEC(
  data = measure.data,
  x.var = "raw.x",
  y.var = "measure"
)
```


```{r check-measure-NEC}
check.chains(out)
```

The function *plot* can be used to plot the fitted model. The estimated NEC value can be obtained directly from the fitted model object, using *out$NEC*. EC*x* estimates can also be obtained from the NEC model fit, using the function *extract_ECx*. Note these may differ from a typical 4-parameter non-linear model, as the NEC model is a broken stick non-linear regression and will often fall more sharply than a smooth 4-parameter non-linear curve.


```{r plot-measure-NEC}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
plot(out)
extract_ECx(out)
```

## Model validation and selection

To explore some model validation, let us revisit our original binomial model. While chain mixing for this model is ok, the residual plot does not look fantastic. Even with good convergence, some model fits may be poor. This can result in over (the data has greater residual variance than that generated by the fitted model) and under- dispersion (the data have less residual variance than that generated by the fitted model). Generally overdispersion is more common, particularly for binomial and poisson models, which are single parameter distributions. 

```{r fit-binomial-NEC2, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(333)
out <- fit.jagsNEC(
  data = binom.data,
  x.var = "raw.x",
  y.var = "suc",
  trials.var = "tot"
)
check.chains(out)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(out)
plot(binom.data$raw.x, out$residuals)
```

A test for over or under-dispersion is performed by jagsNEC, and this can be extracted using *$over.disp*. Values >0.5 indicate over-dispersion and values <0.5 indicate under-dispersion. Values in the range 0.22-0.75 are acceptable. In this case the overdispersion value is 1, indicating quite extreme overdispersion (meaning our model doesn't properly capture the true variability represented in this data). Over and under-dispersion can be due to a poor fitting model, as well as violation of the distribution assumptions of the fitted data (for example, when the response data are poisson, the variance should equal the mean, which is often not the case).

```{r over-disp}
out$over.disp
```

First, let's see if the model fits better using a log transformation of the x-data, given these appear to have been set on a log scaling anyway (based on the spacing between the treatment values). 

```{r fit-binomial-logx-NEC, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(333)
binom.data$log.x <- log(binom.data$raw.x)
out <- fit.jagsNEC(
  data = binom.data,
  x.var = "log.x",
  y.var = "suc",
  trials.var = "tot"
)
check.chains(out)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(out)
plot(binom.data$log.x, out$residuals)
out$over.disp
```

Using the log data the residual plot looks a little better, although there is a tendency to underestimate the response (the residual plot appears to be negatively biased). Note that we still have an over dispersion paramter of 1.

By default jagsNEC will fit a 3 parameter NEC model (model = NEC3param) which has the parameters *top* (the mean value of the response without any effect of the toxicant), *NEC* (the concentration at which an effect of the toxicant begins to occur), and *beta* (the rate of exponential decay of the response). However there are other models that have been implemented, including: NEC4param, which is equivalent to NEC3param but includes a *bot* parameter (the bottom plateau); and ECx4param, with parameters *top* (the upper plateau of the response), *EC50* (the EC50 estimate of the curve), *beta* (the rate of exponential decay of the response), and *bot* (the bottom plateau). The ECx model can be used when evidence for an NEC model is weak (ie there is a consistent decline with increasing concentration and no evidence of a *step*). For model = ECx4param, no NEC value can be formally derived, although an approximation based on the 'NSEC' concept described under 'background' is currently used as an approximation by default on all 'ECx' model output. At this time the concept has not be formally tested and published and should be used with caution.


Let's now try fitting the same data using the 4-parameter NEC model.

```{r fit-binomial-4param-NEC, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(333)
out <- fit.jagsNEC(
  data = binom.data,
  x.var = "log.x",
  y.var = "suc",
  trials.var = "tot",
  model = "NEC4param"
)
check.chains(out)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(out)
plot(binom.data$log.x, out$residuals)
out$over.disp
```

Even for the 4-parameter NEC model we still have an overdisperon value of 1, suggesting that our 95% confidence band on the NEC will be far smaller than what it should be in reality. It does seem there is a more gradual decline in this data, so it is possible the 4-parameter ECx model will fit better. Let's try fitting that now.

```{r fit-binomial-ECx, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(333)
out <- fit.jagsNEC(
  data = binom.data,
  x.var = "log.x",
  y.var = "suc",
  trials.var = "tot",
  model = "ECx4param"
)
check.chains(out)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(out)
plot(binom.data$log.x, out$residuals)
out$over.disp
```

This model does look like it fits a little bit better than the either of the two NEC models. The residual plot shows a more even distribution of the data around the fitted line. However, the overdispersion paramters suggests this model is still over dispersed, meaning our confidence bound are still too narrow.

If your model is overdispersed, there is now an argument to specify *over.disp=TRUE*, which will generalise a poisson model to use a negative binomial distribution (thus allowing the variance and mean to be independent) and for binomial response data will use a beta distribution.


For all model types a wide range of distributions are available for the response variable *y.var*. As detailed above, if *y.type* is unspecified jagsNEC will attempt to guess the right distribution to use. This can of course be manually specified. Here we will set *over.disp=TRUE* to automatically apply a beta model to our binomial data (the same thing could also be achieved through using *y.type="beta"*).


```{r fit-binomial-beta-ECx, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(333)
out <- fit.jagsNEC(
  data = binom.data,
  x.var = "log.x",
  y.var = "suc",
  trials.var = "tot",
  model = "ECx4param",
  over.disp = TRUE
)
check.chains(out)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(out)
plot(binom.data$log.x, out$residuals)
out$over.disp
```

From the results we can see that we now have a much better fit in terms of dispersion, with an over-dispersion paramter of `r out$over.disp`, and much wider more representative confidence bands. Let us see if the *beta* distribution would also have improved our original NEC model fit.


```{r fit-binomial-beta-NEC, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(333)
out <- fit.jagsNEC(
  data = binom.data,
  x.var = "log.x",
  y.var = "suc",
  trials.var = "tot",
  over.disp = TRUE
)
check.chains(out)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(out)
plot(binom.data$log.x, out$residuals)
out$over.disp
```

## Fitting multiple models and model averaging using the fit.jagsMANEC function

### Fitting a fit.jagsMANEC model

So far we have explored how to fit individual models via the function 'fit.jagsNEC'. The jagsNEC package also has a function 'fit.jagsMANEC' that can be used to fit a selection of models, or even all the available models in the package. Note that as these are Bayesian methods requiring multiple MCMC chains using 'fit.jagsMANEC' can be very slow.

```{r fit-beta-MANEC, cache=TRUE}
# set.seed(333)
# out <- fit.jagsMANEC(
#  data = prop.data,
#  x.var = "raw.x",
#  y.var = "resp",
#  n.tries = 1,
#  model.set = "all"
# )
# save(out, file="out_temp.RData")
load(file = "out_temp.RData")
```
Here we run 'fit.jagsMANEC' using model.set =  'all' using the proportional data example for a beta response variable from above, and save the output as an .RData file so that the rmarkdown will not include all of the console output that is generated when these models run. Saving and .RData file of the 'all' model.set fit.jagsMANEC output can be a useful way of fitting all the models at a convenient time (this can be very slow), that means you can reload them to explore and plot, extract values, and modify the model set as required. 

### Exploring a fit.jagsMANEC model

We have created some plotting method functions for our jagsNEC model types, so we can plot a jagsMANECfit model object simply with 'plot'.


```{r plot-beta-MANEC1}
load(file = "out_temp.RData")
plot(out)
```

The default plot looks exactly the same out our regular jagsNECfit plot, but the output is based in a weighted average of all the models fits. The NEC estimate on this plot is based on a mix of actual NEC estimates, as well as the NSEC estimates that are used as an approximation to NEC for all the 'ECx' models in the set. The fitted jagsMANECfit object contains different elements to the jagsNECfit. In particular

```{r modstats-beta-MANEC}
load(file = "out_temp.RData")
out$mod.stats
```

contains the table of model fit statistic for all the fitted models. This includes the model name, the DIC (as returned from jags), DIC.delta (DIC - the lowest DIC), wi (the model weight), pD, and the overdispersion estimate. For this example, three models have relatively similar weights and contribute to the model averaged outcome, including the NEC3param, NEC4param and the ECx4param models, with the NEC4param being overall the highest.

The jagsMANECfit object also contains all of the original fits, which can be extracted using

```{r extract_mod-beta-MANEC}
load(file = "out_temp.RData")
out.NEC3param <- out$mod.fits$NEC3param
```

Which would extract the NEC3param model from the jagsMANECfit and create a new object that contains just this fit. This would be identical to fitting the 'NEC3param' model using 'fit.jagsNEC' as we did above. All of the models can be simultaneously plotted using

```{r plot_mod-beta-MANEC}
load(file = "out_temp.RData")
plot(out, all_models = TRUE)
```


You can see that the 'NECHormesis' model and the 'NECsigmoidal' models are highly unresolved. The 'NECsigmoidal' model in particular poses a theoretical problem as it is a model that has a natural upper plateau. Thus it becomes difficult to resolve where the flat no-effect part of the data ends, and the sigmoidal decline begins. It should not be used, and we may remove it from the model set in future versions. We it is currently retained out of interest and to explore it's behaviour under different scenarios. The 'NECHormesis' model allows an initial linear increase with concentration, prior to the exponential decline of the 'NEC3param' model once the NEC concentration has been reached. This does not work well for this data, but neither does it have substantial weight, so it can be left in the model set for completeness.

The models prefixed with 'ECx' are all models that do not have the NEC as a parameter in the model. That is the are smooth curves as a function of concentration nad have no breakpoint. The NEC on the plot above for these models are an approximation based on 'NSEC' (see above) and should not be used without careful consideration of the validity of this endpoint value. A formal model averaged estimate of NEC should be obtained with 'model.set = NEC', and there is a helper function 'modify_jagsMANEC' that can be used to alter the model set as required. We can use this to obtain first a set of 'NEC' only models


```{r extract_NECmod-beta-MANEC, cache=TRUE}
load(file = "out_temp.RData")
out.NEC <- modify_jagsMANEC(out, model.set = "NEC")
```
 and then drop the 'NECsigmoidal' model as invalid (see above)
 
 
```{r dropmod-beta-MANEC}
load(file = "out_temp.RData")
out.NEC <- modify_jagsMANEC(out.NEC, drop.models = "NECsigmoidal")
out <- modify_jagsMANEC(out, drop.models = "NECsigmoidal")
```

Now we have two model sets, an NEC set and a mixed NEC and ECx set, neither of which have the 'NECsigmoidal' model. Of course before we use this model set for any inference, we would need to check the chains mixing and acf. We can use check.chains on the 'jagsMANECfit'. Note that adding the argument 'pdf.file = "Cl_chains"' to 'check.chains' would write the chain plots out to a pdf file, which can be more convenient, as you can see here 'check.chains' generates a lot of plots on a 'jagsMANECfit'.

```{r checkchains-beta-MANEC}
load(file = "out_temp.RData")
check.chains(out)
```
Chains for the 'NECHormesis' model in this case are very badly mixed, so we should drop this as well from our model sets

```{r dropmod2-beta-MANEC}
load(file = "out_temp.RData")
out.NEC <- modify_jagsMANEC(out.NEC, drop.models = "NECHormesis")
out <- modify_jagsMANEC(out, drop.models = "NECHormesis")
```

Now we can use the extract_ECx function to get EC10 and EC50 values. We can do this using our all model set, because it is valud to use NEC models for estimating ECx.

```{r extract_ecvals-beta-MANEC}
load(file = "out_temp.RData")
ECx10 <- extract_ECx(out, ECx.val = 10)
ECx50 <- extract_ECx(out, ECx.val = 50)

ECx10
ECx50
```

Note that the median estimate is the same as the upper bound. This indicates that the 'absolute' EC50 may lie beyond the observed data, because the lowest values here are just below 0.2, and the 'absolute' ECx type scales between the higher predicted values (usually 'top' or the y-intercept) and 0. We could use type = 'relative' in our call to 'extract_ECx' or we can try extending the 'x.range'. Which you use depends on your specific context and question. Let's try extending the x.range.


```{r extract_ecvals2-beta-MANEC}
load(file = "out_temp.RData")
ECx50 <- extract_ECx(out, ECx.val = 50, x.range = c(0.01, 8))
ECx50
```

This still yields an upper bound that is identical to our upper range, which is again an indication that the upper bound at a concentration of 8 still does not reach our EC50. To extend further it would be better to refit our data using 'model.set = "bot.free"' - as if we want to extrapolate for an absolute ECx value, it may be more valid to only use models that do not have a lower asymptote, but actually will asymptote at zero. Here we will consider our ECx values in relative terms instead for simplicity, which means the ECx values represent a percentage decline in the response relative to the range of the fitted data across the observed range of concentration (x.val). We will do this for both out EC10 and our EC50 to be consistent.


```{r extract_ecvals3-beta-MANEC}
load(file = "out_temp.RData")
ECx10 <- extract_ECx(out, ECx.val = 10, type = "relative")
ECx50 <- extract_ECx(out, ECx.val = 50, type = "relative")

ECx10
ECx50
```

The NEC values can be extracted directly from the NEC model set object, as they are an explicit parameter in these models.

```{r NECvals-beta-MANEC}
load(file = "out_temp.RData")
NECvals <- out.NEC$NEC
NECvals
```

Now we can make a combined plot of our output, showing the model averaged "NEC" model and the "all averaged model", along with the relevant thresholds.


```{r plot_final-beta-MANEC}
load(file = "out_temp.RData")
plot(out, add.NEC = FALSE)

abline(v = ECx10, col = "orange", lty = c(1, 3, 3))
abline(v = ECx50, col = "blue", lty = c(1, 3, 3))
abline(v = NECvals, col = "darkgrey", lty = c(3, 1, 3))
lines(out.NEC$pred.vals$x, out.NEC$pred.vals$y, col = "darkgrey")
lines(out.NEC$pred.vals$x, out.NEC$pred.vals$up, col = "darkgrey", lty = 3)
lines(out.NEC$pred.vals$x, out.NEC$pred.vals$lw, col = "darkgrey", lty = 3)
legend("bottomleft",
  legend = c("Complete averaged model", "EC10", "EC50", "NEC"),
  col = c("black", "orange", "blue", "darkgrey"), lty = 1, bty = "n"
)
```
