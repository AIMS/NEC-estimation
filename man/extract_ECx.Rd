extract_ECx(
  X,
  ECx.val = 10,
  type = "absolute",
  precision = 10000,
  posterior = FALSE,
  hormesis.def = "control",
  xform = NA,
  x.range = NA,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a jag model fit as returned by a call to jags from fit.jagsNEC or fit.jagsMANEC}

\item{ECx.val}{the desired percentage effect value. This must be a value between 1 and 99 (for type = "relative"
and "absolute"), defaults to 10.}

\item{type}{a character vector, taking values of "relative",  "absolute" (the default) or "direct".
Type "relative" is calculated as the percentage decrease from the maximum predicted value of the response (top)
to the minimum predicted value
of the response.
Type "absolute" (the default) is calculated as the percentage decrease from the maximum value of
the response (top)
to 0 (or bot for a 4 parameter model fit where the y data are not bounded by zero).
Type "direct" provides a direct estimate of the x value for a given y.}

\item{precision}{The number of unique x values over which to find ECx - large values will make the ECx estimate more
precise.}

\item{posterior}{A logical value indicating if the full posterior sample of calculated ECx values should be returned
instead of just the median and 95 credible intervals.}

\item{hormesis.def}{takes values of 'max' or 'control' (the default).
If 'control' Absolute and relative ECx values are calculated as a decline from the control.
If 'max' Absolute and relative ECx values are calculated as a decline from the maximum predicted value.}

\item{xform}{A function to apply to the returned estimated concentration values}

\item{x.range}{A range of x values over which to consider extracting ECx}

\item{prob.vals}{A vector indicating the probability values over which to return the estimated ECx value.
Defaults to 0.5 (median) and 0.025 and 0.975 (95 percent credible intervals).}
}
\value{
A vector containing the estimated ECx value, including upper and lower 95 percent Credible Interval bounds
}
\description{
Extracts the predicted ECx value as desired from a jagsNEC or a jagsMANEC model fit.
