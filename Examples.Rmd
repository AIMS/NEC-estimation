## Background

This document contains examples for running the NEC-estimation package currently under development. This code is being worked up by Rebecca Fisher and Gerard Ricardo (AIMS), and David Fox.  The package is being developed at  <https://github.com/AIMS/NEC-estimation> and is a No-Effect-Concentration (NEC) model specific wrapper for the R2jags package available in R. The NEC mode fit is based on the model described in [@Fox2010].

Baysian model fitting can be diffuclt to generalise across a broad range of usage cases, particularly with respect to specifying valid initial values and appropriately vauge priors. This is one reason the use of Bayesian statistics in NEC estimation is currently limited across broader ecotoxicological community, who rarely have access to specialist statistical expertise. The jagsNEC package attempts to provide an accessible interface to the R2jags package specifically for fitting NEC models, with a range of models specified based on the known distribution of the "concentration"or "dose" variable (the predictor, x) as well as the "response" (y) variable. The model forumla, incuding priors and the required init function required to call a jags model are automatically generated based on information contained in the supplied data, and the specified variable types.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
